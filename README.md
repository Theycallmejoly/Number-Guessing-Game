# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number within a specified range, and the player needs to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.

## How It Works

- The script prompts the user to enter the maximum range for the random number generation.
- The player is then given a limited number of attempts to guess the randomly generated number.
- After each incorrect guess, the script provides hints to guide the player closer to the correct answer.
- The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or exhausts all attempts.

## Setup

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script `number_guessing_game.py`:

    ```
    python number_guessing_game.py
    ```

2. **Playing the Game**: Follow the prompts to enter the maximum range and make your guesses.

## Features
